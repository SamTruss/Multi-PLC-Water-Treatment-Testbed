# Phase 2 Testbed - Multi-PLC Water Treatment Plant + SCADA HMI

Three-PLC testbed simulating a water treatment plant, with a Scada-LTS HMI layer and network segmentation.

Please note that this repository is still under active development. Some artefacts may be missing, incomplete, or included as working drafts, and certain documents may not yet reflect the final intended structure. A cleaner production-ready version will be published once the testbed has been finalised.

## Architecture

| Container | Role | Web UI | Modbus port (host) | Network |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| plc1-intake | Water source intake | http://localhost:8081 | 5021 | ot-net |
| plc2-treatment | Chlorine + pH dosing | http://localhost:8082 | 5022 | ot-net |
| plc3-distribution | Pressure + supply | http://localhost:8083 | 5023 | ot-net |
| scadalts | Scada-LTS HMI (DMZ ↔ OT bridge) | http://localhost:9090/Scada-LTS | n/a | dmz-net + ot-net |
| database | MySQL backend for HMI | (no UI) | n/a | dmz-net |
| agent | Python attacker | (no UI) | n/a | dmz-net |

Two Docker networks:
- `ot-net` (172.28.10.0/24) — PLCs only
- `dmz-net` (172.28.20.0/24) — agent, HMI, database

The agent on dmz-net cannot reach PLCs on ot-net directly. Scada-LTS is
dual-homed and is the legitimate bridge between zones.

## First-time setup

```powershell
# Bring everything down (clean slate from previous testbed)
docker compose down -v

# Bring up the multi-PLC + HMI compose
docker compose up -d

# Install agent dependencies
docker exec agent pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
```

Then for each PLC:
1. Open its web UI (8081, 8082, 8083 in turn)
2. Default login: openplc / openplc
3. Go to Programs -> upload the matching .st file
4. Click the program -> Launch program
5. Status should turn green / Running

For the HMI:
1. Open http://localhost:9090/Scada-LTS
2. Default login: admin / admin
3. The HMI is functional but data sources are unconfigured by default
   (manual configuration deferred to v0.2.1)

## Run the acceptance test suite

```powershell
docker exec agent pytest /app/tests/ -v
```

Ten tests covering:
- Phase 1 regression (Modbus tooling, address maps, segmentation)
- Phase 2 acceptance (DMZ isolation, HMI deployment, default-creds vuln, CVE-2025-13791 patched)

## Run the seeded HMI exploit

```powershell
docker exec agent python /app/scripts/exploit_seeded_hmi.py
```

You should see two attack sections:
1. Default credentials accepted - authenticated admin session established (CWE-798)
2. CVE-2025-13791 path traversal probe - documented as patched in Scada-LTS 2.8.0

## Seeded vulnerabilities

| # | Vuln | Implementation | Status |
|---|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Default creds PLC #1 | plc1-intake left with openplc/openplc | Phase 1 |
| 2 | Default creds PLC #2 | plc2-treatment left with openplc/openplc | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Insecure Modbus | All PLCs - no auth, safety-critical regs writable | Phase 1 |
| 4 | Unpatched HMI | Scada-LTS default credentials (CWE-798) | Phase 2 |
| 5 | Permissive firewall #1 | Cross-zone bridge | Phase 4 |
| 6 | Permissive firewall #2 | Cross-zone bridge | Phase 4 |

Phase 2 covers vulns 1-4. Phases 3-4 will complete the seeded set.

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full release plan.

Research use only. Not affiliated with any employer.

⚠️ Intentionally vulnerable. This testbed deliberately ships with weak credentials, insecure Modbus configuration, and a default-credentials HMI. Do not deploy on any network reachable by untrusted hosts. Use an isolated VM or air-gapped host.
